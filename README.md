## Linguistic annotation of the SI-IUS corpus

This project contains the siIUS corpus containing historical Slovene
legal texts.  The complex TEI encoding of the source siIUS digital
library available from https://dihur.si/si-ius/ is here simplified,
and its text tokenised.

The complete Git sources are stored in the gitignored GitGroup/ directory,
just the TEI XML documents in the DARIAH/ directory, 
the conversion scripts in the bin/ directory (and the Makefile),
and the output corpus files in the CLARIN/ directory.

As further work it will be PoS tagged, and lemmatised with annotated
term candidates, converted to vertical file and made available under
the CLARIN.SI concordancers.

The compilation of the siIUS digital library is supported by
DARIAH-SI, and the compliation of the siIUS annotated corpus by
CLARIN.SI.
